## State and effects

Use the framework's message loop as the UI state owner. Commands/effects call
services and return typed results; worker goroutines do not mutate model maps,
slices, or widgets concurrently. Copy or transfer ownership of mutable payloads
deliberately. `View` renders a snapshot without probing tools or mutating state.

```text
input / timer → Update → model snapshot → View
                  ↓
             effect(service, context, request ID)
                  ↓
             result message → accept if still current
```

Track a generation/request ID per independently refreshed view or query. Starting
a replacement read supersedes the previous generation. Include identity in every
result and reject stale success AND stale failure before changing visible state.
Cancel owned work when superseded or closed, but retain generation checks because
cancellation races with completion. Closed dialogs must not reappear on a reply.

When operations have dependencies, invalidate the dependent observation rather
than presenting it as current. Do not require every optional tab to finish
before one view becomes usable. Model these outcomes distinctly:

| Result | UI behavior |
|---|---|
| Loading with existing rows | Keep rows, show pending refresh |
| Accepted fresh result | Replace snapshot; restore selection by ID |
| Accepted successful empty result | Remove obsolete rows and show empty state |
| Refresh error | Keep usable snapshot with error and its provenance |
| Cached result | Label cached/stale; it is not completion of the live read |
| Unknown observation | Preserve unknown; do not render as false/clean/healthy |

Track pending mutations by operation/target identity so repeated input does not
start conflicting writes. A completion updates the affected state and exposes
the result. Retry reads when appropriate; do not blindly retry writes with an
unknown outcome. Reconcile state first. Cancelling a wait does not roll back
already-applied effects; show partial outcomes explicitly.

## Startup and responsiveness

Construct a useful initial shell before scans, network requests, subprocesses,
large cache decoding, or release checks. Load the active view first and optional
views on demand. Fresh local state can appear independently of remote state.
Avoid expensive initialization before `Program.Run()` as well as inside Update.

Use bounded concurrency and cancelable contexts for I/O. For log streams or large
collections, keep a bounded display buffer or virtualized viewport while keeping
required durable data elsewhere. Coalesce superseded snapshots/progress updates;
do not drop business events or mutation receipts. Log follow mode is explicit;
scrolling backward stops following until the user resumes it.

Choose refresh cadence from workload and measure it. Do not make a fixed FPS cap
the definition of smoothness or add sleeps to hide a backlog. Separate producer,
model-update, layout, and rendering costs before optimizing.

For a performance investigation, record startup stages, navigation/update time,
queue growth, rows processed, and refresh completion under representative data.
An initial `View` return is not proof that the terminal has painted a frame.
Use delayed fake services for deterministic behavior tests plus a real PTY for
perceived input latency. Report data size and terminal/multiplexer environment;
avoid claiming universal millisecond targets from one machine.

Diagnostic tracing should be opt-in and bounded. Prefer relative timing,
operation categories, and counts over sensitive raw paths, commands, or errors.
Write trace files outside the active screen stream, ideally after restoration.

## Terminal ownership

One component owns input parsing and terminal modes. Use the framework's supported
model composition and external-program execution mechanisms, checked against the
selected major version. Do not start a second reader/form over a running TUI.

Before an editor, pager, interactive child, or suspension, release/restore the
terminal; after return, reacquire it, refresh relevant state, and restore focus.
Handle ordinary completion, error, and cancellation through the same return path.
Keep child errors visible without abandoning a usable dashboard.

Use cleanup paths for raw mode, alternate screen, cursor visibility, mouse
capture, bracketed paste, and enabled keyboard protocols. Test normal quit,
startup failure, handled signals, and supported panic recovery. `os.Exit` skips
defers; keep it at the entrypoint after cleanup. SIGKILL cannot run cleanup.
In raw mode, explicitly handle Ctrl+C and any supported suspend/resume behavior.

Subprocesses use structured executable/argument calls and a context rather than
unescaped shell concatenation. Logs go to a separate sink or through messages
to a UI log view; a background `fmt.Println` can corrupt the screen.

## Lessons from dev-cli

paths or installed `dev` command are needed by this skill.

The generic policies here are synthesis, not a request to copy dev's task states,
SSH trust model, registry, eight tabs, or entire safety architecture. Match the
size of the implementation to the new application's actual risks and workload.

## Overlays that outlive background discovery

Keep ownership of each asynchronous result explicit. A late discovery result
may update available targets, but must not replace a pending operation's review
or result surface. Process an operation's own completion even if another
surface is visible; otherwise its pending flag can remain stuck forever.
After a write or an unknown outcome, mark affected cached views stale and
refresh them before claiming the displayed state is current. Preserve useful
old data with a stale marker while the refresh is pending.

This is a lazyclash workbench regression case, reviewed 2026-09-20; apply it
where an application has overlapping discovery, forms and remote operations.
